          <h1> About Us</h1>
          <h3>Lifewire's mission is to help people get the most out of the technology that dominates all of our lives
            today.<br> We
            provide context for the latest technology news, an extensive library of updated educational how-to articles,
            and
            independent product advice and reviews to more than 15 million users each month.

            Our goal is to help consumers understand what is happening in the world of tech, figure out what products
            enhance
            their lives, and learn how to make it all work. We aim to be the trustworthy, friendly, and authoritative
            voice for
            people who use their tech every single day and expect it to work. When it doesn't, they want to search for
            an
            answer, get it working, and get on with their day. This is what we help them do.

            We have more than 80 technology professionals—authors, educators, software developers, speakers,
            consultants, tech
            support agents, and more—all working together to create technology news, product advice, and how-to articles
            that
            you can trust.

            Getting the best value for money was the leading factor when choosing which store to shop at for groceries
            among
            primary grocery shoppers in U.S. households in 2015.Other leading factors included a convenient location,
            products
            always being in stock, and a fast checkout experience.

          QA teams want a supplier who presents them with a straightforward case about “why our product’s safety and
          quality is not worth worrying about.”

          The most compelling evidence is a third party audit result— which reads like a physical exam for your
          company’s food safety practices. In the absence of that, a thoughtfully compiled and organized set of food
          safety policies and records can signal that your business is serious about food safety. Ultimately, the QA
          team will describe their needs — and it’s important to listen. Dozens of times, I’ve been able to get my
          clients’ products into new retailers despite their inability to meet the “official” supplier qualifications.
          All I did was follow the instructions we were given, provide the documents that we were able to come up with,
          and present it in an easy-to-read format.
